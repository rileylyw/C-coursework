TESTING FOR PARSER:

*** How to run the test ***
-make test_parse
      test_parse_s


-used assert testing inside test.c
-passed in temporary strings as tokens to check if the grammar is correct



TESTING FOR INTERP:


1. For testing C functions
*** How to run the test ***
make test_interp
     test_interp_s 

2. For testing program outputs
*** How to run the test ***
-make test_interp_shell
-cd Test_interp folder
-run ./test_interp.sh at terminal

-it tests the program output (output.txt) against the expected output (*.txt), the *.nlb files contain different combinations of functions. If the program output matches the expected output, "Test *.txt OK" will be shown. Otherwise, "Test *.txt NOT OK" will be shown.
